This is a free C++ library of a Bayesian Atlas building framework with hierarchical priors.

The implementation includes image matching by Maximum A Posterior (MAP) and Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM) for atlas building algorithms for 2D/3D medical images. 

Our code uses fundamental modules from FLASH (https://bitbucket.org/FlashC/flashc/src/master/).

This code is only for research purpose, and we request
